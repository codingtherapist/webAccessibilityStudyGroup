<h2> Web Accessibility Group Study Outline Material</h2>

Our [official study plan](https://github.com/users/codingtherapist/projects/1) lives in the "projects" section of Github and contains the material we are learning each week. Each week has an outline of what we will be studying on stream and homework, with an area for comments if anyone has any questions or comments etc.<br><br>



Below is the material we will be using as we study weekly to supplement the above study guide:<br>

- If you are not familiar with the WAS or CPACC please read the "About" material linked below. <br>

- The "Study Outline" is what we will be following loosely during live streams, starting with the CPACC outline. <br>

- The "Body of Knowledge" is the official documentation for that topic ranging from 102 pages for the CPACC and 42 pages for the WAS. <br>

- The sample questions are question we should be able to answer once we finish studying that section.

- If you'd like to learn more about the IAAP which is the association that holds these certifications check out [IAAP](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/about)

<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>
<h3>This is not a structured accessibility learning course, it is a study group</h3>
This is a study group for newbies and professionals who would like to get together to study accessibility topics. While @africakenyah feels confident in her skills in accessibility testing, she does not have a lot of experience shipping accessible code. We will be learning and studying those concepts together, building things that may or may not work. If you are interested in learning in a casual, low stakes environment with other accessibility enthusiasts, this is the right place. If you are interested in a structured web accessibility course, this is not a good fit.

<h3>Members can join the livestream via video as a guest on twitch!</h3>
We will be streaming weekly on twitch, sharing concepts and live coding accessible elements. While @africakenyah will be the one streaming, others in the study group can join the stream via video as a co-streamer on any week. Co- streamers can choose to teach the group a concept, ask questions, or just turn their camera on and study silently. Alternatively (and highly encouraged), <b>accessibility professionals with experience can request to lead the study group and give clarity on the subjects we are learning for the week</b>. A calendly calendar will be created for members to sign up for co streaming any of the upcoming weeks. The twitch chat will always be available for communication to those who prefer to chat and watch only.

<h3>We will meet weekly, but life happens</h3>
While the intent is to meet every week and hold ourselves accountable to that, life happens. As a full time professional with a personal life, there may be weeks we do not meet on twitch. However, the discord will always be available for members to chat and meet for silent study or discussion at their discretion. If anyone else has a twitch and would like to lead a week, that is an option as well!
